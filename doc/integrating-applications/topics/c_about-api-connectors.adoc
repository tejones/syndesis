= Requirements for REST API client connectors

After you upload an OpenAPI schema to {prodname}, a connector to the REST API
becomes available. You can select the connector to create
a REST API client connection. You can then create a new integration and 
add the REST API client connection, or you can edit an existing integration 
to add the REST API client connection. 

{prodname} connectors support OAuth 2.0, HTTP basic
authorization, and API keys. If access to the REST API requires Transport Layer Security (TLS)
then the API needs to use a valid certificate that is issued by
a recognized Certificate Authority (CA).

A REST API that uses OAuth must have an authorization URL that takes a client
callback URL as input. After {prodname} creates the connector and before you
use the connector to create a connection, you must visit that URL to 
register your {prodname} environment as a client of the REST API.
This authorizes your {prodname} environment to access the REST API. As part
of registration, you provide the {prodname} callback URL. 
The details for doing this are described in
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#register-with-rest-apis_rest[{NameOfFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}, Registering with REST APIs].

The OpenAPI schema for a REST API client connector cannot have cyclic schema 
references. For example, a JSON schema that specifies a request or 
response body cannot reference itself as a whole nor reference any 
part of itself through any number of intermediate schemas.

{prodname} cannot create connectors for REST APIs that support the HTTP 2.0
protocol.
